                <p>To expand on my skills of web development, I plan on taking on the challenge of learning a new programming language, JavaScript. The reason I want to learn JavaScript is to add more interactivity to my sites, as well as for when I choose to learn other skills that require, or at least with its help, know JavaScript, such as React.js and jQuery. In order to achieve my goal, I use different resource that I come across, such as MDN Web Docs and YouTube.</p>
                <p>Once I feel that I have somewhat a grasp of the language, I will use what I have learned to build a site.</p>
                <h3>Reviewing the Basics</h3>
                <p>To begin my journey, I wanted to review what I already knew about javascript: the basics of the language. To review the fundamentals, I looked through MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#language_basics_crash_course">JavaScript basics</a>. Following MDN's guide, I reviewed the basics, and then used it to learn how to add features to a site. On top of using the basics, I also learned about some DOM API features, such as Web Storage API, for the features added to the site. The features added were adding an image changer and adding a personalized welcome message. Below is the code from what I have reviewed and learned:</p>
