                <p>To expand on my skills of web development, I plan on taking on the challenge of learning a new programming language, JavaScript. The reason I want to learn JavaScript is to add more interactivity to my sites, as well as for when I choose to learn other skills that require, or at least with its help, know JavaScript, such as React.js and jQuery. In order to achieve my goal, I use different resource that I come across, such as MDN Web Docs and YouTube.</p>
                <p>Once I feel that I have somewhat a grasp of the language, I will use what I have learned to build a site.</p>

                  <h3>Reviewing the Basics <span>Week 1</span></h3>
                  <p>To begin my journey, I wanted to review what I already knew about javascript: the basics of the language. To review the fundamentals, I looked through MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#language_basics_crash_course">JavaScript basics</a>. Following MDN's guide, I reviewed the basics, and then used it to learn how to add features to a site. On top of using the basics, I also learned about some DOM API features, such as Web Storage API, for the features added to the site. The features added were adding an image changer and adding a personalized welcome message. Below is the code from what I have reviewed and learned:</p>

                  <h3>Javascript Objects <span>Week 2 and 3</span></h3>
                  <p>On this week, continuing with MDN's JavaScript Guide, I moved on to javascript objects. However, before that I did an assessment from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Image_gallery#assessment_or_further_help">MDN Web Docs</a> that tested my understanding of the basics of javascript by creating a javascript powered image gallery. While I do have a good grasp on the basics, it was a little different when it came to actually implementing it together to create the gallery, but I was able to do it. Here is the finish product: </p>

                  </picture>
                  <p>And here is my javascript code: </p>
                  <picture>
                    <img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="../../img/week2day1code.png" alt="Week 2 Code: Image Gallery">
                  </picture> <p>After completing that assessment, I went on to javascript objects as I followed through MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects">Introducing JavaScript objects</a>. I have not finished going through it but I was able to go through the basics of working with it, like creating an object, using and changing its properties, and using constructors. Below is the code showing what I learned:</p>
                  <picture>
                    <img style="width:100%; height:auto;" src="../../img/week2day2code.png" alt="Week 2 Code">
                  </picture>
                  <p>The following week I continued to learn how to use javascript objects with object-oriented programming, using MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming">Object-oriented programming</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript">Classes in JavaScript</a> articles, and using the objects to work with JSON, using MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON">Working with JSON data</a> article.</p>
                  <p>I was able to understand the concepts of class-based object-oriented programming in javascript as it is a concept that is also in C++, a programming language that I already have a basic understanding of. With objects-oriented programming, there are the concepts of classes and instances, which are like a blueprint for creating objects, inheritance, creating classes from existing classes, and encapsulation, dividing and putting together data and functions depending on its internal state.</p>
                  <p>I already had somewhat of an understanding of JSON, but there were still things I didn't know about it. JSON is a data format that follows the javascript syntax. To get a better grasp of it, I followed the example in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON">Working with JSON data</a> article that uses their <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json">JSON data that is on their Github</a>. This is the outcome and the html and javascript code:</p>
