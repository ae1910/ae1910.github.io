                <p>To expand on my skills of web development, I plan on taking on the challenge of learning a new programming language, JavaScript. The reason I want to learn JavaScript is to add more interactivity to my sites, as well as for when I choose to learn other skills that require, or at least with its help, know JavaScript, such as React.js and jQuery. In order to achieve my goal, I use different resource that I come across, such as MDN Web Docs and YouTube.</p>
                <p>Once I feel that I have somewhat a grasp of the language, I will use what I have learned to build a site.</p>

                  <h3>Reviewing the Basics <span>Week 1</span></h3>
                  <p>To begin my journey, I wanted to review what I already knew about javascript: the basics of the language. To review the fundamentals, I looked through MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#language_basics_crash_course">JavaScript basics</a>. Following MDN's guide, I reviewed the basics, and then used it to learn how to add features to a site. On top of using the basics, I also learned about some DOM API features, such as Web Storage API, for the features added to the site. The features added were adding an image changer and adding a personalized welcome message. Below is the code from what I have reviewed and learned:</p>

                  <h3>Starting on Javascript Objects <span>Week 2</span></h3>
                  <p>On this week, continuing with MDN's JavaScript Guide, I moved on to javascript objects. However, before that I did an assessment from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Image_gallery#assessment_or_further_help">MDN Web Docs</a> that tested my understanding of the basics of javascript by creating a javascript powered image gallery. While I do have a good grasp on the basics, it was a little different when it came to actually implementing it together to create the gallery, but I was able to do it. Here is the finish product: </p>

                  </picture>
                  <p>And here is my javascript code: </p>

                  </picture> <p>After completing that assessment, I went on to javascript objects as I followed through MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects">Introducing JavaScript objects</a>. I have not finished going through it but I was able to go through the basics of working with it, like creating an object, using and changing its properties, and using constructors. Below is the code showing what I learned:</p>

                  <p>Next week, I will continue with javascript objects.</p>
