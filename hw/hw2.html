                <p>Art can be made from anything. Like what Aurlea Harvey said in an interview (can be seen in <a href="https://www.rightclicksave.com/article/auriea-harvey-and-the-future-of-digital-sculpture?hss_channel=tw-1486737250826211340">Auriea Harvey and the Future of Digital Sculpture</a>) "...everything has the potential to make a total work of art". It is not limited to one style, one technique, or even, one medium. So as technology continued to develop, there is no surprise that art would and could be made using the technology. When reading <a href="https://oldobjectsnewideas.com/_reading/greene_netart.pdf">Web Work: A History of internet Art</a>, you can see just how the characteristics connected to the Internet were, and are, taken advantage of to create art, which became known as Net.art.</p>
                <p>I did the same using p5.js: </p>
                <div id="sketch-holder"></div>
                <p>I wanted to create something that would remind you of water. To do this, I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">The Coding Train's</a> videos. Specifically, I used the videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZUdGqeOD0w">2D Water Ripples</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI1dmHv3MeM">Polar Perlin Noise Loops</a>.</p>
